This was a personal project that's archived because It's old and bad. Could be re-done much better. The original idea was a bot that when put in several servers would be able to tell you what people were in both servers in a large list. The motivation is because I enjoyed seeing what people I were in "mutual" servers with in many big servers. But having to individually click on every single humans profile wasn't very sensible, so I made a bot do it instead. It was a fun learning experience.
